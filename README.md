# Advent of Code 2021
## Overview
Even though it is my first adventure with [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) event, I wanted to set the bar quite high. On a first thought, I wanted to make all of the tasks in one language, which I wasn't much familiar with, so I picked [Go](https://go.dev/). However, after finishing first task quite easily, I decided to make this challenge *exactly* 25 times harder and code **each task in a different language**. I found a [list](https://www.benkraft.org/2017/12/26/advent-of-code/) containing 25 different approaches to the Advent of Code and picked it as my guide/inspiration for the month. Therefore, here I am completing *my collection* of languages tried out...

## Progress so far
### Day 1 - Go
The first day surprised me with how easy the task was. Working with Golang turned out to be rather easy and intuitive.
### Day 2 - Bash script
Honestly, I was scared of Bash at first from previous classes at my university. However, Bash turned out to *not be as black as it is painted*. I suppose the task was easy enough to not feel any unbearable pain while coding.
### Day 3 - UCBLogo
Dear God, that was hard as fuck. I found little to no help on the Internet and spent almost whole day learning about assigning/retrieving values to/from arrays and lists. The syntax is very old-fashioned, like really *assembly-old-fashioned* in my opinion. The errors don't help you shit. Error codes are mentioned in the manual, *cool*, but could you like give me any hint what those mean, like wtf? You can imagine my satisfaction and relief when the second task finally worked as intended.
### Day 4 - Perl, C++, **the end**
Welp, as you can probably see from the commit history, I still didn't present the solution to day 4 as of the date of this commit (06/12/21), so I consider myself finished with the challenge.<br>
Nevertheless, hear me out: **I tried**, ***really***. At first, I wanted to do 4th day in Perl. After some reading, I still didn't get the concepts of weird, different variable creating. So I gave up and gave it a shot in C++. I was on the right path to succeed, but I just didn't have enough time that day. On top of that, I still felt kinda exhausted after a whole day of torturing my mind with Logo.

## Conclusion
So, to sum up: I'll do better next year. And lower the challenge bar a bit, probably :). Merry Christmas to everyone reading this, tho.
