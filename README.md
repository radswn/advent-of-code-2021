# Advent of Code 2021
## Overview
Even though it is my first adventure with [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) event, I wanted to set the bar quite high. On a first thought, I wanted to make all of the tasks in one language, which I wasn't much familiar with, so I picked [Go](https://go.dev/). However, after finishing first task quite easily, I decided to make this challenge *exactly* 25 times harder and code **each task in a different language**. I found a [list](https://www.benkraft.org/2017/12/26/advent-of-code/) containing 25 different approaches to the Advent of Code and picked it as my guide/inspiration for the month. Therefore, here I am completing *my collection* of languages tried out...
